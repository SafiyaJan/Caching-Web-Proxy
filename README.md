# Caching-Web-Proxy

Hello!

- This respository contains a caching web proxy that I have written in C
- The proxy is set up to accept incoming accept incoming connections, read and parse requests, forward requests to web servers, read the serversâ€™ responses, and forward those responses to the corresponding clients using HTTP requests and socket programming
- The proxy can deal with multiple concurrent connections by using multithreading
- Caching is added to proxy by using a simple main memory cache of recently accessed web content.
